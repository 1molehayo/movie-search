# Movie search

This app should be a movie search with two pages:

- **Home page:** search field and a list with the results;  
  _Think about empty state, loading state and movie not found_
- **Movie page:** movie details page;  
  _Think about loading state and movie not found_

The purpose of this challenge is to evaluate your HTML, CSS, Javascript and API skills and overall approach while composing a simple web app given a set of screens and an API feed.

## Main skills

1. Writing a solid application
2. Making API calls
3. Filter data and shape it to display on the UI
4. How well you improvise the app design

## What is expected

- A functional app with the two screens (`Home` and `Details`);
- A clean layout and design;
- A way to tag movies as _favourites_ (and having them persist would be great!);

## Necessary information

We suggest using [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/), although you can use any other API you prefer

## Setup

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, you need to add an env file, then run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
